# data transformation

The process of data transformation consists of scaling data and data type transformation. In a typical building related data set the scale of variables can vary largely due to different units used.
The power demand may change from 0 kW to thousands of kW, the temperature (eg, outdoor temperature, indoor temperature, supply temperature of the system) can range from − 20°C to °C or a typical signal of a fan can range from 0 to 1.

## data scaling
The purpose of data scaling is to normalize the data variables so that they end up being equally important in data analysis from a quantity point of view. The methods used for data scaling include max-min normalization, Z-score normalization, and decimal point normalization

### data segmentation
The segmentation (or summarization) task aims at creating an accurate approximation of time series, by reducing its dimensionality while retaining its essential features.
