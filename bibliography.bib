abstract = {Data cleaning, or data preparation is an essential part of statistical analysis. In fact, in practice it is often more time-consuming than the statistical analysis itself. These lecture notes describe a range of techniques, implemented in the R statistical environment, that allow the reader to build data cleaning scripts for data suffering from a wide range of errors and inconsistencies, in textual format. These notes cover technical as well as subject-matter related aspects of data cleaning. Technical aspects include data reading, type conversion and string matching and manipulation. Subject-matter related aspects include topics like data checking, error localization and an introduction to imputation methods in R. References to relevant literature and R packages are provided throughout.},

abstract = {The pervasive monitoring of HVAC systems through Building Energy Management Systems (BEMSs) is enabling the full exploitation of data-driven based methodologies for performing advanced energy management strategies. In this context, the implementation of Automated Fault Detection and Diagnosis (AFDD) based on collected operational data of Air Handling Units (AHUs) proved to be particularly effective to prevent anomalous running modes which can lead to significant energy waste over time and discomfort conditions in the built environment. The present work proposes a novel methodology for performing AFDD, based on both unsupervised and supervised data-driven methods tailored according to the operation of an AHU during transient and non-transient periods. The whole process is developed and tested on a sample of real data gathered from monitoring campaigns on two identical AHUs in the framework of the Research Project ASHRAE RP-1312. During the start-up period of operation, the methodology exploits Temporal Association Rules Mining (TARM) algorithm for an early detection of faults, while during non-transient period a number of classification models are developed for the identification of the deviation from the normal operation. The proposed methodology, conceived for quasi real-time implementation, proved to be capable of robustly and promptly identifying the presence of typical faults in AHUs.},

abstract = {Energy consumption data must be presented to office occupants to encourage them to save energy when in their office buildings. Therefore, this work develops an early warning application (EWA) that intelligently analyzes electricity consumption and provides a real-time visualization of anomalous consumption based on data from smart meters and sensors to various stakeholders. Although smart meters collect massive amounts of data from different sources, many systems cannot analyze and informatively present rapidly collected data. Accordingly, they do not motivate people to adopt energy-saving behaviors. The contribution of this study is to design an EWA architecture that visually presents real-time anomalous power consumption in an office space based on data that are obtained from various instruments (smart meters and sensors) to office occupants. The anomalous consumption of the EWA dashboard is designed to ensure that office occupants with limited technical skills understand the presented energy consumption data. The collected anomaly data provide post-occupancy information. Electricity consumption data from smart meters and sensors in a real office space are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EWA. A building manager can use archived anomaly data to audit energy consumption, to produce an energy reduction policy, and to support a retrofitting strategy.},

abstract = {Since a traditional centralized control system (e.g., building energy management system) with a fixed schedule and manual control is not appropriate to irregularly occupied rooms, it is expected to have a large amount of energy saving potential in operating the HVAC system. To overcome this challenge, this study aimed to develop a novel operation approach for the energy efficiency improvement of the HVAC system in office spaces. The real-time indoor environmental indicators were collected and analyzed to evaluate the current operation status of the HVAC system as well as to propose a novel control strategy in two ways. The significant findings can be illustrated as follows. First, it could be stated that occupants would tend to establish a lower set-point temperature for a cooler indoor environment. To solve this issue, a basic control strategy was proposed to detect the anomaly detection of the HVAC system and to automatically adjust the indoor temperature within a preferred range. Second, it could be evaluated that the HVAC system would be kept operating since occupants would forget to turn off the HVAC system after the meetings. To solve this issue, an advanced control strategy was proposed to operate the automatic on/off control of the HVAC system by considering the indoor temperature and CO2 concentration in real time. The proposed strategies can contribute to a large amount of energy savings in operating the HVAC system of irregularly occupied spaces.},

@article{Esling2012,
abstract = {In almost every scientific field, measurements are performed over time. These observations lead to a collection of organized data called time series. The purpose of time-series data mining is to try to extract all meaningful knowledge from the shape of data. Even if humans have a natural capacity to perform these tasks, it remains a complex problem for computers. In this article we intend to provide a survey of the techniques applied for time-series data mining. The first part is devoted to an overview of the tasks that have captured most of the interest of researchers. Considering that in most cases, time-series task relies on the same components for implementation, we divide the literature depending on these common aspects, namely representation techniques, distance measures, and indexing methods. The study of the relevant literature has been categorized for each individual aspects. Four types of robustness could then be formalized and any kind of distance could then be classified. Finally, the study submits various research trends and avenues that can be explored in the near future. We hope that this article can provide a broad and deep understanding of the time-series data mining research field. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

@article{Fan2019,
abstract = {Building operations have evolved to be not only energy-intensive, but also information-intensive. Advanced data-driven methodologies are urgently needed to facilitate the tasks in building energy management. Currently, there are two main bottlenecks in analyzing building operational data. Firstly, few methodologies are available to represent and analyze data with complicated structures. Conventional data analytics are capable of analyzing information stored in a single two-dimensional data table, while lacking the ability to handle multi-relational databases. Secondly, it is still challenging to visualize the analysis results in a generic and flexible fashion, making it ineffective for knowledge interpretations and applications. As a promising solution, graphs can integrate and represent various types of information, providing promising approaches for the knowledge discovery from massive building operational data. This study proposes a novel graph-based methodology to analyze building operational data. The methodology consists of various stages and provides solutions for data exploration, graph generations, knowledge discovery and post-mining. It has been applied to analyze the actual building operational data of a public building in Hong Kong. The research results validate the potential of the graph-based methodology in characterizing high-level building operation patterns and atypical operations.},

@article{Butler2015,
abstract = {In time series analysis research, there is a strong interest in discrete representations of real valued data streams. One approach still considered state-of-the-art is the Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) algorithm. The interest of this paper concerns the SAX assumption of data being highly Gaussian and the use of the standard normal curve to choose partitions to discretize the data. The SAX approach chooses partitions on the standard normal curve that would produce an equal probability for each symbol. This procedure is generally valid as a time series is normalized to have $\mu$ = 0 and $\sigma$ = 1. However, there exists a caveat to this assumption of equi-probability due to the intermediate step of Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA). We show in this paper that when PAA is applied, the distribution of the data is altered, resulting in a shrinking standard deviation that is proportional to the number of points used to create a segment of the PAA representation and the degree of auto-correlation within the series. Data that exhibits statistically significant auto-correlation is less affected by this shrinking distribution. As the standard deviation of the data contracts, the mean remains the same, however the distribution is no longer standard normal and therefore the partitions based on the standard normal curve are no longer valid for the assumption of equal probability.},

abstract = {Managing supply and demand in the electricity grid is becoming more challenging due to the increasing penetration of variable renewable energy sources. As significant end-use consumers, and through better grid integration, buildings are expected to play an expanding role in the future smart grid. Predictive control allows buildings to better harness available energy flexibility from the building passive thermal mass. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of the building stock, developing computationally tractable control-oriented models, which adequately represent the complex and nonlinear thermal-dynamics of individual buildings, is proving to be a major hurdle. Data-driven predictive control, coupled with the “Internet of Things”, holds the promise for a scalable and transferrable approach, with data-driven models replacing traditional physics-based models. This review examines recent work utilising data-driven predictive control for demand side management application with a special focus on the nexus of model development and control integration, which to date, previous reviews have not addressed. Further topics examined include the practical requirements for harnessing passive thermal mass and the issue of feature selection. Current research gaps are outlined and future research pathways are suggested to identify the most promising data-driven predictive control techniques for grid integration of buildings.},

@article{Miller2015,
abstract = {The amount of sensor data generated by modern building systems is growing rapidly. Automatically discovering the structure of diurnal patterns in this data supports implementation of building commissioning, fault detection and retrofit analysis techniques. Additionally, these data are crucial to informing design professionals about the efficacy of their assumptions and strategies used in performance prediction simulation models. In this paper, we introduce DayFilter, a day-typing process that uses Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), motif and discord extraction, and clustering to detect the underlying structure of building performance data. Discords, or infrequent daily patterns, are filtered and tagged for deeper, detailed analysis of potential energy savings opportunities. Motifs, or the most frequent patterns, are detected and further aggregated using k-means clustering. This procedure is designed for application on whole building and sub-system metrics from hierarchical building and energy management systems (BMS/EMS). The process transforms quantitative raw data into qualitative subgroups based on daily performance similarity and visualizes them using expressive techniques. We apply DayFilter on 474 days of example data from an international school campus in a tropical climate and 407 days of data from an office building from a temperate European climate. Discords are filtered resulting in 17 and 22 patterns found. Selected discords are investigated and many correlate with specific failures and energy savings detected by the on-site operations staff. Six and ten motif candidates are detected in the two case studies. These motifs are then further aggregated to five and six performance clusters that reflect the typical operational behavior of those projects. We discuss the influence of the parameter choices and provide initial parameter settings for the DayFilter process.},

In order to detect abnormal electricity consumption behavior in AMI. Firstly, GMM-LDA clustering feature learning algorithm is used to cluster some data sets to obtain the optimal feature representations of normal pattern feature database and abnormal pattern database. Then, an adaptive updating mechanism of pattern database is introduced to make the abnormal detection model adapt to the dynamic changes of network environment, and the labeled data set is compiled. The training samples are sent to the PSO-SVM classifier for learning. Finally, the unknown label data sets are classified, and the abnormal electricity data can be traced back to the suspected users, so that realize the key monitoring of the suspected users. Experiments on existing data sets show that the proposed detection model not only avoids the dependence on manual classification in supervised training samples, but also has higher detection accuracy and lower false alarm rate than single or other algorithms.},

It was hypothesized that the proposed framework will provide flexible yet cost effective energy efficiency solutions. Our specific contributions are (1) critical evaluation of existing EV systems, (2) development of framework with respect to operational, technical and budgetary challenges that are specific to light commercial businesses, (3) a computerized program to guide business owners through a step-by-step process involved in the development and installation of the EV system. To test the hypothesis, a field study was conducted by performing energy audits at 15 light commercial businesses. On average, the cost of the EV system was found to be 5{\%} of the annual energy cost. Overall, the findings from our field study conclude that the proposed EV system is economical and flexible enough to address “varied and unique” energy efficiency requirements of light commercial businesses.},

abstract = {Nowadays, vast amounts of data on building operation and management have been collected and stored. However, the data is rarely translated into useful knowledge about building energy performance improvement, due mainly to its extreme complexity and a lack of effective data analysis techniques. This paper reports the development of a new methodology for examining all associations and correlations between building operational data, thereby discovering useful knowledge about energy conservation. The method is based on a basic data mining technique (association rule mining). To take full advantage of building operational data, both daily and annual time periods should be mined. Moreover, data from two different years should be mined, and the obtained associations and correlations in the two years should be compared. In order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, the method was applied to the operational data of the air-conditioning system in a building located in Montreal. The results show energy waste in the air-conditioning system as well as equipment faults. A low/no cost strategy for saving energy in the system operation was also proposed. The results obtained could help to better understand building operation and provide opportunities for energy conservation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the area of time series representation, the Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) method has established itself quite visibly resulting in a number of useful results. However, the PAA technique usually leads to some losses of information. In order to overcome this issue, we propose a representation approach called Piecewise Aggregate Pattern Representations (PAPR). In the PAPR method, the range of values assumed in the temporal segment is divided into several regions with equal probability. In the sequel, some statistics of the regions, such as the number, the mean and the variance of points falling within each region, are determined. A matrix (pattern) containing all these statistical characteristics is constructed to represent the corresponding segment of the time series. We incorporate the PAPR method into anomaly detection by computing the similarity of patterns and using a Random Walk (RW) model, as a classifier, to determine the similarity values. Finally, the connectivity and anomaly ranks of patterns are obtained with the use of the RW model. The overall anomaly detection approach is referred to as PAPR-RW. Experimental studies are reported for synthetic data sets and two publicly available data sets: electrocardiograms (ECGs) data and the video surveillance data. Compared with the PAA-based method, the PAPR-RW approach exhibits a higher level of robustness and detects anomalies more accurately.},

abstract = {Energy transitions are reshaping global and national energy systems and appropriate decision-making strategies are needed to drive an effective change in response to pressing global issues. Governmental institutions, industry, academia, and civil society are all participating to this global change, playing different roles. Open energy models and associated data are essential to promote open science practices, and create an effective science-policy interaction. For example, they can foster multi-disciplinary research addressing the co-evolution of energy technologies and human behaviour more transparently and, more in general, they can improve the interaction of multiple linked models and data, by improving them with respect to the current state of the art. In this paper, we present an analysis of features of open energy models and data, highlighting essential information that can be shared among communities of researchers in the energy field to foster multidisciplinary research. This information inherently embodies different key concepts and perspectives in modelling that affect both simulation and optimization processes employed for energy systems planning, design and operation. Indeed, this shared knowledge is crucial to overcome critical technical issues (e.g. end-use energy efficiency improvements, energy conversion processes, energy infrastructures operation, etc.) that may inhibit successful energy transitions. Finally, ecosystems of interacting open data and models are key assets for the development of next generation energy services and technologies, based on innovative business models in which the problem of monitoring, verifying and tracking performance transparently (at multiple levels) will be fundamental.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a visualization system for users to study multivariate time series data. They first identify trends or anomalies from a global view and then examine details in a local view. Specifically, we train a neural network to project high-dimensional data to a two dimensional (2D) planar space while retaining global data distances. By aligning the 2D points with a predefined color map, high-dimensional data can be represented by colors. Because perceptual color differentiation may fail to reflect data distance, we optimize perceptual color differentiation on each map region by deformation. The region with large perceptual color differentiation will expand, whereas the region with small differentiation will shrink. Since colors do not occupy any space in visualization, we convey the overview of multivariate time series data by a calendar view. Cells in the view are color-coded to represent multivariate data at different time spans. Users can observe color changes over time to identify events of interest. Afterward, they study details of an event by examining parallel coordinate plots. Cells in the calendar view and the parallel coordinate plots are dynamically linked for users to obtain insights that are barely noticeable in large datasets. The experiment results, comparisons, conducted case studies, and the user study indicate that our visualization system is feasible and effective.},

abstract = {Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) as a major symbolic representation has been widely used in many time series data mining applications. However, because a symbol is mapped from the average value of a segment, the SAX ignores important information in a segment, namely the trend of the value change in the segment. Such a miss may cause a wrong classification in some cases, since the SAX representation cannot distinguish different time series with similar average values but different trends. In this paper, we firstly design a measure to compute the distance of trends using the starting and the ending points of segments. Then we propose a modified distance measure by integrating the SAX distance with a weighted trend distance. We show that our distance measure has a tighter lower bound to the Euclidean distance than that of the original SAX. The experimental results on diverse time series data sets demonstrate that our proposed representation significantly outperforms the original SAX representation and an improved SAX representation for classification. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the effect of the depth of submetering (i.e., from whole-building level to system level to equipment level and further to sensor level) on the energy savings that can be achieved in energy analytics or energy information system (EIS) implementations. An EIS is defined as a combination of software and hardware systems that gather energy-related data, feed it into an analytics engine, and present building operators with analyses that allow them to reduce energy consumption. Data regarding the energy savings, the depth of submetering in the EIS implementation, and the cost of submetering was gathered for 21 case (building portfolio) studies and analyzed to determine if there is a relationship between the depth of submetering and the energy savings achieved. It was found that in general, deeper submetering does in fact appear to enable deeper energy savings. The one exception to this is sensor-level data: the addition of detailed sensor level metering to other higher levels of metering data does not seem to enable deeper energy savings in EIS implementations. Detailed findings in energy savings, cost and cost-effectiveness were presented for different levels of metering that may provide insightful rule-of-thumb estimations for similar implementations.},

Secondly, control-perfect index based on the process exergy analysis is presented as an evaluation factor for the operation of HVAC system. In addition, the original control of system is used as the 1st benchmark to estimate the energy saving capacity of proposed strategy. The ideal operation, which is obtained through the global optimization of exergy loss models, is used as the 2nd benchmark to estimate the improving potential of candidate strategy. Finally, twelve control strategies used in the airport HVAC system are evaluated through the CPI analysis of both component and system. Their energy saving ratios to Benchmark 1 and improving potentials to Benchmark 2 are compared, respectively.},

abstract = {Buildings are responsible for 40{\%} of global energy use and contribute towards 30{\%} of the total CO2 emissions. The drive to reduce energy use and associated greenhouse gas emissions from buildings has acted as a catalyst in the development of advanced computational methods for energy efficient design, management and control of buildings and systems. Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are the major source of energy consumption in buildings and ideal candidates for substantial reductions in energy demand. Significant advances have been made in the past decades on the application of computational intelligence (CI) techniques for HVAC design, control, management, optimization, and fault detection and diagnosis. This article presents a comprehensive and critical review on the theory and applications of CI techniques for prediction, optimization, control and diagnosis of HVAC systems. The analysis of trends reveals that the minimisation of energy consumption was the key optimization objective in the reviewed research, closely followed by the optimization of thermal comfort, indoor air quality and occupant preferences. Hardcoded Matlab program was the most widely used simulation tool, followed by TRNSYS, EnergyPlus, DOE-2, HVACSim+ and ESP-r. Metaheuristic algorithms were the preferred CI method for solving HVAC related problems and in particular genetic algorithms were applied in most of the studies. Despite the low number of studies focussing on multi-agent systems (MAS), as compared to the other CI techniques, interest in the technique is increasing due to their ability of dividing and conquering an HVAC optimization problem with enhanced overall performance. The paper also identifies prospective future advancements and research directions.},

By recasting the time series as a matrix it becomes possible to use SVD to highlight the underlying patterns and periodicities. This is done without the need for specifying user-defined parameters. From a data mining perspective, this opens up new ways of analyzing time series in a data-driven, bottom-up fashion. However, in order to get correct results, it is important to understand how the SVD-spectrum of a time series is influenced by various characteristics of the underlying signal and noise.

This paper proposes a methodology for (i) the automatic estimation of the building Primary Energy Demand for space heating (PEDh) and (ii) the characterization of the relationship between the PEDh value and the main building features reported by Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs). The proposed methodology relies on a two-layer approach and was developed on a database of almost 90,000 EPCs of flats in the Piedmont region of Italy. First, the classification layer estimates the segment of energy demand for a flat. Then, the regression layer estimates the PEDh value for the same flat. A different regression model is built for each segment of energy demand. Four different machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network) are used and compared in both layers. Compared to the current state-of-the-art, this paper brings a contribution in the use of data mining techniques for the asset rating of building performance, introducing a novel approach based on the use of independent data-driven models. Such configuration makes the methodology flexible and adaptable to different EPCs datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can estimate the energy demand with reasonable errors, using a small set of building features. Moreover, the use of Decision Tree algorithm enables a concise interpretation of the quantitative rules used for the estimation of the energy demand. The methodology can be useful during both designing and refurbishment of buildings, to quickly estimate the expected building energy demand and set credible targets for improving performance.},

abstract = {Today's building automation system (BAS) provides us with a tremendous amount of data on actual building operation. Buildings are becoming not only energy-intensive, but also information-intensive. Data mining (DM) is an emerging powerful technique with great potential to discover hidden knowledge in large data sets. This study investigates the use of DM for analyzing the large data sets in BAS with the aim of improving building operational performance. An applicable framework for mining BAS database is proposed. The framework is implemented to mine the BAS database of the tallest building in Hong Kong. After data preparation, clustering analysis is performed to identify the typical power consumption patterns of the building. Then, association rule mining is adopted to unveil the associations among power consumptions of major components in each cluster. Lastly, post-mining is conducted to interpret the rules. 457 rules are obtained in association rule mining, of which the majority can be easily deduced from domain knowledge and hence be ignored in this study. Four of the rules are used for improving building performance. This study shows that DM techniques are valuable for knowledge discovery in BAS database; however, solid domain knowledge is still needed to apply the knowledge discovered to achieve better building operational performance. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

However, while the Smart Grid design strate-gies have been studied by academia, only anecdotal guidance is provided to the industry with respect to increasing the level of grid intelligence. In this paper, we report on a successful project in assisting the industry in this way, via conducting a large anomaly-detection study on the data of one of the power distribution companies in the Czech Republic. In the study, we move away from the concept of single events identified as anomaly to the concept of collective anomaly, that is itemsets of events that may be anomalous based on their patterns of appearance. This can assist the operators of the distribution system in the transformation of their grid to a smarter grid. By analyzing Smart Meters data streams, we used frequent itemset mining and categorical clustering with clustering silhouette thresholding to detect anomalous behaviour. As the main result, we provided to stakeholders both a visual representation of the candidate anomalies and the identification of the top-10 anomalies for a subset of Smart Meters.},

In the proposed method, 14 attributes obtained through DGAM are utilized as the initial and unprocessed inputs of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). In this method, attribute selection and improved learning algorithm are utilized to enhance fault detection and recognition precision. In the propounded fault detection and classification method, the most instructive attributes obtained by DGAM are selected by association rules learning technique (ARLT). Using efficient enlightening attributes and eliminating tautological attributes lead to higher accuracy and superior operation. Furthermore, appropriate training of ANFIS has significant effect on its precision and robustness. Therefore, Black Widow Optimization Algorithm (BWOA) is applied to train the ANFIS. Having excellent exploration and extraction capability, fast convergence speed and simplicity is the main reason for choosing the BWOA as the learning algorithm. Two industrial datasets are utilized to test and evaluate the performance of the put forward method. The results show that the propounded diagnosis system has high accuracy, robust performance and short run time. Selecting the most educative attributes of DGAM, training ANFIS optimally, improving the robustness of ANFIS and increasing the classification accuracy are the main contribution of this paper in the field of power transformer fault detection and classification.},

abstract = {Understanding and tuning the performance of extreme-scale paral- lel computing systems demands a streaming approach due to the computational cost of applying offline algorithms to vast amounts of performance log data. Analyzing large streaming data is challenging because the rate of receiving data and limited time to comprehend data make it difficult for the analysts to sufficiently examine the data without missing important changes or patterns. To support streaming data analysis, we introduce a visual analytic framework comprising of three modules: data management, analysis, and interactive visual- ization. The data management module collects various computing and communication performance metrics from the monitored system using streaming data processing techniques and feeds the data to the other two modules. The analysis module automatically identifies important changes and patterns at the required latency. In particular, we introduce a set of online and progressive analysis methods for not only controlling the computational costs but also helping analysts better follow the critical aspects of the analysis results. Finally, the interactive visualization module provides the analysts with a coher- ent view of the changes and patterns in the continuously captured performance data. Through a multi-faceted case study on perfor- mance analysis of parallel discrete-event simulation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for identifying bottlenecks and locating outliers.},

abstract = {Practical building operations usually deviate from the designed building operational performance due to the wide existence of operating faults and improper control strategies. Great energy saving potential can be realized if inefficient or faulty operations are detected and amended in time. The vast amounts of building operational data collected by the Building Automation System have made it feasible to develop data-driven approaches to anomaly detection. Compared with supervised analytics, unsupervised anomaly detection is more practical in analyzing real-world building operational data, as anomaly labels are typically not available. Autoencoder is a very powerful method for the unsupervised learning of high-level data representations. Recent development in deep learning has endowed autoencoders with even greater capability in analyzing complex, high-dimensional and large-scale data. This study investigates the potential of autoencoders in detecting anomalies in building energy data. An autoencoder-based ensemble method is proposed while providing a comprehensive comparison on different autoencoder types and training schemes. Considering the unique learning mechanism of autoencoders, specific methods have been designed to evaluate the autoencoder performance. The research results can be used as foundation for building professionals to develop advanced tools for anomaly detection and performance benchmarking.},

In the energy field, smart grids are enabling a unprecedented data acquisition with the integration of sensors and smart devices. In the context of renewable energies, there has been an increasing interest in solar photovoltaic energy generation. These installations are often integrated with smart sensors that measure the energy production. Such amount of data collected makes the quest for developing smart monitoring systems that can detect anomalous behaviour in these systems, trigger alerts and enable maintenance operations. In this paper, we propose a generic, unsupervised and scalable framework for anomaly detection in time series data, based on a variational recurrent autoencoder. Furthermore, we introduce attention in the model, by means of a variational self-attention mechanism (VSAM), to improve the performance of the encoding-decoding process. Afterwards, we perform anomaly detection based on the probabilistic reconstruction scores provided by our model. Our results on solar energy generation time series show the ability of the proposed approach to detect anomalous behaviour in time series data, while providing structured and expressive representations. Since it does not need labels to be trained, our methodology enables new applications for anomaly detection in energy time series data and beyond.},

abstract = {Clustering is the partitioning of a set of objects into groups (clusters) so that objects within a group are more similar to each others than objects in different groups. Most of the clustering algorithms depend on some assumptions in order to define the subgroups present in a data set. As a consequence, the resulting clustering scheme requires some sort of evaluation as regards its validity. The evaluation procedure has to tackle difficult problems such as the quality of clusters, the degree with which a clustering scheme fits a specific data set and the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning. In the literature, a wide variety of indices have been proposed to find the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning of a data set during the clustering process. However, for most of indices proposed in the literature, programs are unavailable to test these indices and compare them. The R package NbClust has been developed for that purpose. It provides 30 indices which determine the number of clusters in a data set and it offers also the best clus- tering scheme from different results to the user. In addition, it provides a function to perform k-means and hierarchical clustering with different distance measures and aggre- gation methods. Any combination of validation indices and clustering methods can be requested in a single function call. This enables the user to simultaneously evaluate sev- eral clustering schemes while varying the number of clusters, to help determining the most appropriate number of clusters for the data set of interest.},

In this paper, a data-driven framework for network-wide anomaly detection in electric power distribution systems is proposed specifically to detect anomalies in primary distribution voltage magnitude measurements. The central hypothesis is that the voltage measurements at a given time-step for different buses of a phase in the power distribution system are correlated. This hypothesis is thoroughly validated for different distribution test systems. Upon leveraging this observation, the first stage of the proposed anomaly detection framework utilizes Batch Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - a dimensionality reduction technique - to reduce the dimensionality of the input data (voltage measurements). The second stage of the proposed framework entails the approach for anomaly detection and identification using the residuals computed from the PCA model. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated using the IEEE 8500-node distribution test system to detect missing and bad data anomalies.},

The methodology has been tested on the whole electrical load of buildings for two case studies, and its flexibility and robustness have been confirmed. In order to demonstrate the implications for a preliminary diagnosis, some unexpected trends of the total electrical load have also been discussed in a post-mining phase, using additional datasets related to heating and cooling electrical energy needs.

The total energy request in buildings can be significantly reduced by detecting abnormal consumption effectively. Numerous models are used to tackle this problem but either they are very complex and mostly applicable to components level, or they cannot be adopted for different buildings and equipment. In this study a simplified approach to automatically detect anomalies in building energy consumption based on actual recorded data of active electrical power for lighting and total active electrical power of a cluster of eight buildings is presented. The proposed methodology uses statistical pattern recognition techniques and artificial neural ensembling networks coupled with outliers detection methods for fault detection. The results show the usefulness of this data analysis approach in automatic fault detection by reducing the number of false anomalies. The method allows to identify patterns of faults occurring in a cluster of bindings; in this way the energy consumption can be further optimized also through the building management staff by informing occupants of their energy usage and educating them to be proactive in their energy consumption. Finally, in the context of smart buildings, the common detected outliers in the cluster of buildings demonstrate that the management of a smart district can be operated with the whole buildings cluster approach.},

abstract = {Effective feedback can reduce building power consumption and carbon emissions. Therefore, providing information to building managers and tenants is the first step in identifying ways to reduce power consumption. Since reducing anomalous consumption can have a large impact, this study proposes a novel approach to using large sets of data for a building space to identify anomalous power consumption. This method identifies anomalies in two stages: consumption prediction and anomaly detection. Daily real-time consumption is predicted by using a hybrid neural net ARIMA (auto-regressive integrated moving average) model of daily consumption. Anomalies are then identified by differences between real and predicted consumption by applying the two-sigma rule. The experimental results for a 17-week study of electricity consumption in a building office space confirm that the method can detect anomalous values in real time. Another contribution of the study is the development of a formalized methodology for detecting anomalous patterns in large data sets for real-time of building office space energy consumption. Moreover, the prediction component can be used to plan electricity usage while the anomaly detection component can be used to understand the energy consumption behaviors of tenants. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Data-driven methods for fault detection and diagnosis of air handling units (AHUs) have attracted wide attention as they do not require high-level expert knowledge of the system of concern. This paper presents a decision tree based data-driven diagnostic strategy for AHUs, in which classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm is used for decision tree induction. A great advantage of the decision tree is that it can be understood and interpreted and therefore its reliability in fault diagnosis can be validated by both testing data and expert knowledge. A steady-state detector and a regression model are incorporated into the strategy to increase the interpretability of the diagnostic strategy developed. The proposed strategy is validated using the data from ASHRAE 1312-RP. It is shown that this strategy can achieve a good diagnostic performance with an average F-measure of 0.97. The interpretation of the diagnostic decision tree using expert knowledge showed that some diagnostic rules generated in the decision tree comply with expert knowledge. Nevertheless, the interpretation also indicated that some diagnostic rules generated are not reliable and some of them are only valid under certain operating conditions, which indirectly demonstrated the importance of the interpretability of fault diagnostic models developed using data-driven methods.},

abstract = {Distributed power meters (also termed smart plugs) are embedded systems that measure the electric power consumption of individual appliances at a fine temporal resolution. They enable a wide range of novel smart services, e.g., accurately forecasting power consumption or making recommendations how to save energy. However, distributed power metering combines high sampling rates with a potentially large number of monitored outlets. A torrent of power readings may thus be generated, incurring high bandwidth requirements for their transmission and a significant computational power demand for their processing. In this paper, we present a concept for the efficient local storage and processing of power consumption data called PowerSAX. Instead of operating on raw sensor readings, PowerSAX converts consumption data into their symbolic representations and thus mitigates their storage requirement. Subsequently, it enables embedded systems to recognize relevant patterns (motifs) in the symbolic representations of collected data. By only transmitting a message when a known motif is encountered in the sensor data, PowerSAX can significantly reduce an application's bandwidth requirements. We evaluate PowerSAX using real-world power consumption data and show to which extent smart plugs can make predictions of an appliance's future power demand.},

abstract = {Energy management information systems (EMIS) play a critical role in providing actionable insights into building operations, timely feedback, and—ultimately—large energy savings. Current EMIS technologies often focus on industrial applications or require large upfront investments and trained operators, therefore greatly limiting its penetration into existing buildings. This paper integrates methods from social, building, and data sciences to understand limitations of current EMIS systems and inform the design of a new Multitiered Energy Management Performance Indicators (MEMPI) framework for characterizing the energy performance of buildings. Specifically, we employed a mixed methods research approach in which we first conduct in-depth qualitative interviews of 10 facility managers and energy consultants. We utilize the insights from our interviews to inform the design of the MEMPI framework, which harnesses highly granular data from already installed advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) (i.e., smart meters). The MEMPI framework employs quantile regression to first benchmark the energy performance of buildings to each other and generate key performance indicators (KPIs). We apply the MEMPI framework to real data from 569 public school buildings in California and measure their energy performance across multiple time scales (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly). Finally, we conduct case studies to compare insights from the MEMPI framework to the perceptions of facility managers overseeing 8 schools through a mixed methods qualitative and quantitative post-interview survey. Results from the case study show that facility managers' perceptions of the performance of their schools were largely accurate, yet the poor energy performance from certain pieces of building equipment and operating schedules was overlooked by building managers. Overall, the MEMPI framework aims to bridge the gap between data-driven energy management models and qualitative domain knowledge held by facility managers to provide more comprehensive insights into the energy performance of buildings.},

abstract = {Developing advanced fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) techniques for building chillers is becoming increasingly essential for building energy saving. Previous FDD studies have mainly concentrated on the model performance, while fewer studies have examined the chiller fault action mechanism. This paper, therefore, proposes a method that can conduct both fault diagnosis and fault action mechanism explanation of building chillers. The method is data-driven-based and can be trained by system operational data based on the classification based on association (CBA) algorithm. Also, it is qualitatively based because system operational rules can be extracted from the diagnostic model by association rule mining. The fault diagnosis process and the fault action mechanism on the chiller system can be then understood by rule interpretation. The experimental chiller data of ASHRAE RP-1043 is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results show that the CBA-based fault diagnosis model can well identify seven common chiller faults with an overall diagnostic accuracy of 90.15{\%}. In this work, the key rules of each fault are extracted and visualized. The mined rules can be well interpreted by domain knowledge, and the action mechanisms of seven faults are concluded. Moreover, the discrepant rule analysis can provide a proper reference for multiple fault decoupling. The knowledge discovered from the fault diagnosis process is valuable for the development of FDD researches and shortcuts for field application.},

However, it is still challenging to utilize the method in practice. One of the major barriers is that mined rules are always highly redundant and numerous. And, there is a lack of effective data transformation approaches specified for HVAC system to transform numerical data into categorical data adaptively. In this study, a kernel density estimation-based data transformation approach is proposed to transform data adaptively. Numerical data are grouped into several categories according to an estimated density function. Measurements in the same category is transformed into a unified text form. A rule clustering-based post mining approach is proposed to filter the mined rules. Only rules which are significantly different from others in the same cluster are extracted. Evaluations are made on one-year historical data obtained from chiller plants of the HVAC system in a commercial center in Shenzhen, China. Results show that the proposed data transformation approach is effective in outlier identification and data transformation. The proposed post mining approach filters out 43.9{\%} of the mined rules successfully.},

In particular, we consider the event patterns related to anomalies such as outliers and deviations, which are important factors in system monitoring for manufacturing processes. In this paper, we propose a method for discovering the rules to describe deviant event patterns from multivariate time series, called SAX-ARM (association rule mining based on symbolic aggregate approximation). Inverse normal transformation (INT) is first adopted for converting the distribution of time series to the normal distribution. Then, symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) is applied to symbolize time series, and association rule mining (ARM) is used for discovering frequent rules among the symbols of deviant events. The experimental results show the discovery of informative rules among deviant events in a multivariate time series from a die-casting manufacturing process that has ten variables with 1,437 lengths. We also present the results of sensitivity analysis, which demonstrates that significant rules can be discovered with different settings of the SAX parameters. The results describe the usefulness of the proposed method to identify deviant event among multivariate time series with high complexity.},

abstract = {Fault diagnosis for centrifugal chillers is very important for saving energy and maintaining optimal operating conditions. A fault diagnosis method for centrifugal chillers is proposed based on the associative classification (AC) algorithm, which constructs an associative classifier by excavating strong rules between fault classes and physical attributes. First, association rules with significant support and high confidence values are discovered. Instead of the Apriori algorithm, FP-growth is adopted to accelerate association rule mining. Second, only association rules named class association rules (CARs) whose consequents are limited to fault classes are preserved. Third, pruned CARs are obtained by means of ranking CARs and pruning the redundant rules according to the concept of “higher rank”. Fourth, a limited number of rules are selected out of pruned CARs based on the AC algorithm to construct an associative classifier. This approach is validated using experimental centrifugal chiller data from the ASHRAE Research Project 1043 (RP-1043). Results demonstrate that this proposed AC-based approach can effectively identify seven common chiller faults at both low and high severity levels and the average correct fault diagnosis ratio can be examined up to 86.3{\%}.},

There is still a lack of effective post mining solutions for filtering out the association rules without physical meanings and the redundant association rules automatically. To fill in this gap, a post mining method is proposed in this study. A graph-based distance correlation indicator is proposed to remove the association rules without physical meanings. In addition, a rule generalization-based fusion approach is proposed to remove the redundant association rules. The method is evaluated using the one-year operation data of a chiller plant of a public building. A total of 149,588 raw double-variable association rules are obtained. Results show that the proposed post mining method can remove 99.72{\%} of the raw association rules. Only 425 association rules are left finally to be further checked. Control strategies, anomalous operation patterns and device faults are revealed from the 425 association rules successfully.},

Residential microgrid is a dynamic and complex cyber-physical system, which consists of multiple cooperative, non-cooperative and even conflicting entities. Random and separate demand-side management of the multiple entities may have detrimental effects on the grid reliability like the peak “rebound” issue and on the economic benefits for both utilities and consumers. Harmonized coordination, not merely unorganized cooperation, among cooperative entities and negotiation among non-cooperative entities based on information sharing are therefore needed to achieve the neighborhood-level optimal solutions in a residential microgrid. This paper comprehensively reviews the state-of-the-art classification, technologies, architectures, and techniques for neighborhood-level coordination and negotiation in residential microgrids. Various types of coordination and negotiation behaviors are first categorized. The technologies, i.e., demand-side flexible resources involved in coordination and negotiation, are then summarized and introduced, including flexible loads, storage, and distributed generations. The typical architectures for coordination and negotiation are then classified into centralized, decentralized, hierarchical distributed, and non-hierarchical distributed architecture. Last, the major coordination and negotiation techniques, including multi-agent system, optimization and game theory, are reviewed and summarized. The challenges and opportunities for each technique are identified and critically discussed.},

While thermal comfort has been shown to differ from person to person and vary over time, these systems are often operated based on prefixed setpoints and schedule of operations or at the request/routine of each individual. This leads to occupants' discomfort and energy wastes. To enable the improvements in both comfort and energy efficiency autonomously, in this paper, we describe the necessity of an integrated system of sensors (e.g., wearable sensors/infrared sensors), infrastructure for enabling system interoperability, learning and control algorithms, and actuators (e.g., HVAC system setpoints, ceiling fans) to work under a governing central intelligent system. To assist readers with little to no exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), we describe the fundamentals of an intelligent entity (rational agent) and components of its problem-solving process (i.e., search algorithms, logic inference, and machine learning) and provide examples from the literature. We then discuss the current application of intelligent personal thermal comfort systems in buildings based on a comprehensive review of the literature. We finally describe future directions for enabling application of fully automated systems to provide comfort in an efficient manner. It is apparent that improvements in all aspects of an intelligent system are be needed to better ascertain the correct combination of systems to activate and for how long to increase the overall efficiency of the system and improve comfort.},

abstract = {The monitoring and management of high-volume feature-rich traffic in large networks offers significant challenges in storage, transmission, and computational costs. The predominant approach to reducing these costs is based on performing a linear mapping of the data to a low-dimensional subspace such that a certain large percentage of the variance in the data is preserved in the low-dimensional representation. This variance-based subspace approach to dimensionality reduction forces a fixed choice of the number of dimensions, is not responsive to real-time shifts in observed traffic patterns, and is vulnerable to normal traffic spoofing. Based on theoretical insights proved in this paper, we propose a new distance-based approach to dimensionality reduction motivated by the fact that the real-time structural differences between the covariance matrices of the observed and the normal traffic is more relevant to anomaly detection than the structure of the training data alone. Our approach, called the distance-based subspace method, allows a different number of reduced dimensions in different time windows and arrives at only the number of dimensions necessary for effective anomaly detection. We present centralized and distributed versions of our algorithm and, using simulation on real traffic traces, demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative advantages of the distance-based subspace approach.},

abstract = {Symbolic Aggregate approximation (SAX) is a classical symbolic approach in many time series data mining applications. However, SAX only reflects the segment mean value feature and misses important information in a segment, namely the trend of the value change in the segment. Such a miss may cause a wrong classification in some cases, since the SAX representation cannot distinguish different time series with similar average values but different trends. In this paper, we present Trend Feature Symbolic Aggregate approximation (TFSAX) to solve this problem. First, we utilize Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) approach to reduce dimensionality and discretize the mean value of each segment by SAX. Second, extract trend feature in each segment by using trend distance factor and trend shape factor. Then, design multi-resolution symbolic mapping rules to discretize trend information into symbols. We also propose a modified distance measure by integrating the SAX distance with a weighted trend distance. We show that our distance measure has a tighter lower bound to the Euclidean distance than that of the original SAX. The experimental results on diverse time series data sets demonstrate that our proposed representation significantly outperforms the original SAX representation and an improved SAX representation for classification.},

Traditional sources of information about energy consumption, such as smart sensor devices and surveys, can be costly to set up, may lack contextual information, have infrequent updates, or are not publicly accessible. In this paper, we propose to use social media as a complementary source of information for understanding energy-consuming activities. A huge amount of social media posts are generated by hundreds of millions of people every day, they are publicly available, and provide real-time data often tagged to space and time. We design an ontology to get a better understanding of the energy-consuming activities domain and develop a text and image processing pipeline to extract from social media the description of energy-consuming activities. We run a case study on Istanbul and Amsterdam. We highlight the strength and weakness of our approach, showing that social media data has the potential to be a complementary source of information for describing energy-consuming activities.

abstract = {This study presents an agglomerative hierarchical clustering-based strategy using Shared Nearest Neighbours and multiple dissimilarity measures to identify typical daily electricity usage profiles of university library buildings. The proposed strategy takes the advantages of three dissimilarity measures (i.e. Euclidean distance, Pearson distance and Chebyshev distance) to calculate the difference between daily electricity usage profiles. Two-year hourly electricity usage data collected from two different university library buildings were employed to evaluate the performance of this strategy. It was shown that this strategy, which considered both magnitude dissimilarity and variation dissimilarity simultaneously, can identify more informative typical daily electricity usage profiles, in comparison with other twelve clustering-based strategies which used a single dissimilarity measure. Some interesting information related to building energy usage behaviours was also discovered with the help of visualisation techniques. Additional or hidden information discovered using this strategy can potentially be useful for fault detection and diagnosis and performance enhancement of library buildings.},

abstract = {Enormous amounts of data are being produced everyday by submeters and smart sensors installed in different kinds of buildings. If leveraged properly, that data could assist end-users, energy producers and utility companies in detecting anomalous power consumption and understanding the causes of each anomaly. Therefore, anomaly detection could stop a minor problem to become widespread, costly and time-consuming issue. Moreover, this will help in better decision-making to reduce wasted energy and promote sustainable and energy efficiency behavior. In this regard, this paper is proposed to indepthly review existing frameworks of anomaly detection in power consumption and provide a critical analysis of existing solutions. Specifically, a comprehensive survey is introduced, in which a novel taxonomy is introduced to classify existing algorithms based on different factors adopted in their implementation, such as the machine learning algorithm, feature extraction approach, detection level, computing platform, application scenario and privacy preservation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first review article that discusses the anomaly detection in building energy consumption. Moving forward, important findings along with domain-specific problems, difficulties and challenges that remain unresolved are thoroughly discussed, including the absence of: (i) precise definitions of anomalous power consumptions, (ii) annotated datasets, (iii) unified metrics to assess the performance of existing solutions, and (iv) platforms for reproducibility. Following, insights about current research trends that anomaly detection technology needs to target for widespreading its application and facilitate its implementation are described before deriving a set of challenging future directions attracting significant research and development attention.},

abstract = {Heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and refrigeration (HVAC{\&}R) systems operated under faulty condition often result in extra energy consumption (up to 30{\%} for commercial buildings) and cost, less comfort control and bad indoor/outdoor air quality, especially when multiple faults happening simultaneously. This study presents a novel hybrid strategy that combines support vector machine (SVM) and multi-label (ML) technique for the automated detection and diagnosis of multiple-simultaneous faults (MSF), and elaborates its application to a building chiller. One of the great advantages ML has against the mono-label (mL) technique is that no MSF data are needed for model training while a good FDD performance for MSF could be obtained. Two individual chiller faults and one of their combinations (an MSF) were investigated. Detailed studies on the use of three features sets and the training of the model with/without normal or/and MSF data were conducted and compared with the mL-SVM model. The results show that the ML-SVM model trained on the normal and two individual faults has an excellent performance, especially when the eight fault-indicative features (Feat8) were employed (correct rate over 99.9{\%}). Feat8 behaves still excellent even when Gaussian white noise has been added to the test data. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

From 1976 to 2014, management performance reported by 305 EMS cases (105 BEMS cases, 103 I/C/F EMS cases and 97 cases of EMS for equipment) is analyzed to evaluate varied energy saving effects. Statistical results show that saving effects of BEMS increased from 11.39{\%} to 16.22{\%} yearly. Inversely, saving effects of I/C/F EMS decreased from 18.89{\%} to 10.35{\%}. Regarding to EMS for equipment, there is no obvious trend but only the averaged saving effect can be reported. EMS for artificial lighting systems has the highest saving effect up to 39.5{\%} in average. For HVAC and other equipment, energy saving effects are around 14.07{\%} and 16.66{\%} respectively. These energy saving performances are correlated with developed EMS functions. The key EMS functions could be identified from their developing progress for effective energy savings. Based on the quantitative analysis, the future trends of EMS are discussed.},

abstract = {Many high level representations of time series have been proposed for data mining, including Fourier transforms, wavelets, eigenwaves, piecewise polynomial models etc. Many researchers have also considered symbolic representations of time series, noting that such representations would potentiality allow researchers to avail of the wealth of data structures and algorithms from the text processing and bioinformatics communities. While many symbolic representations of time series have been introduced over the past decades, they all suffer from two fatal flaws. Firstly, the dimensionality of the symbolic representation is the same as the original data, and virtually all data mining algorithms scale poorly with dimensionality. Secondly, although distance measures can be defined on the symbolic approaches, these distance measures have little correlation with distance measures defined on the original time series. In this work we formulate a new symbolic representation of time series. Our representation is unique in that it allows dimensionality/numerosity reduction, and it also allows distance measures to be defined on the symbolic approach that lower bound corresponding distance measures defined on the original series. As we shall demonstrate, this latter feature is particularly exciting because it allows one to run certain data mining algorithms on the efficiently manipulated symbolic representation, while producing identical results to the algorithms that operate on the original data. In particular, we will demonstrate the utility of our representation on various data mining tasks of clustering, classification, query by content, anomaly detection, motif discovery, and visualization.},

The central objective of the research is to outline the path that has been taken throughout the last decade towards a people‐centric approach, discussing how users switched from being passive receivers of IoT services to being an active part of it. Basing on existing studies, authors performed what was a necessary and unprecedented grouping of the IoT applications to the thermal comfort into three categories: the thermal comfort studies with IoT hardware, in which the approach focuses on physical devices, the mimicking of IoT sensors and comfort using Building Simulation Models, based on the dynamic modelling of the thermal comfort through IoT systems, and Crowdsensing, a new concept in which people can express their sensation proactively using IoT devices. Analysing the trends of the three categories, the results showed that Crowdsensing has a promising future in the investigation through the IoT, although some technical steps forward are needed to achieve a satisfactory application to the thermal comfort matter.},

abstract = {Reducing the overall energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector is essential for meeting our future sustainability goals. Recently, smart energy metering facilities have been deployed to enable monitoring of energy consumption data with hourly or subhourly temporal resolution. This unprecedented data collection has created various opportunities for advanced data analytics involving load profiles (e.g., building energy benchmarking programs, building-to-grid integration, and calibration of urban-scale energy models). These applications often need preprocessing steps to detect daily load profile discords, such as: 1) outliers due to system malfunctions (the bad) and 2) irregular energy consumption patterns, such as those resulting from holidays (the ugly) compared to normal consumption patterns (the good). However, current preprocessing methods predominantly focus on filtering using statistical threshold values, which fail to capture the contextual discords of daily profiles. In addition, discord detection algorithms in building research are often aimed at finding individual building-level discords, which are not suitable at a large scale. Thus, in this paper, we develop a method for automated load profile discord identification (ALDI) in a large portfolio of buildings (more than 100 buildings). Specifically, ALDI 1) uses the matrix profile (MP) method to quantify the similarities of daily subsequences in time series meter data, 2) compares daily MP values with typical-day MP distributions using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and 3) identifies daily load profile discords in a large building portfolio. We evaluate ALDI using the metering data of both an academic campus and a residential neighborhood. Our results demonstrate that ALDI efficiently discovers measurement errors by system malfunctions and low energy consumption days in the academic campus portfolio, and it detects unique load shape patterns likely driven by occupant behavior and extreme weather conditions in the residential neighborhood.},

abstract = {A fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) tool is a type of energy management and information system that continuously identifies the presence of faults and efficiency improvement opportunities through a one-way interface to the building automation system and the application of automated analytics. Building operators on the leading edge of technology adoption use FDD tools to enable median whole-building portfolio savings of 8{\%}. Although FDD tools can inform operators of operational faults, currently an action is always required to correct the faults to generate energy savings. A subset of faults, however, such as biased sensors, can be addressed automatically, eliminating the need for staff intervention. Automating this fault "correction" can significantly increase the savings generated by FDD tools and reduce the reliance on human intervention. Doing so is expected to advance the usability and technical and economic performance of FDD technologies. This paper presents the development of nine innovative fault auto-correction algorithms for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning pi(HVAC) systems. When the auto-correction routine is triggered, it overwrites control setpoints or other variables to implement the intended changes. It also discusses the implementation of the auto-correction algorithms in commercial FDD software products, the integration of these strategies with building automation systems and their preliminary testing.},

abstract = {Buildings account for 32{\%} of worldwide energy usage. A new regime of exciting new “applications” that span a distributed fabric of sensors, actuators and humans has emerged to improve building energy efficiency and operations management. These applications leverage the technological advances in embedded sensing, processing, networking and methods by which they can be coupled with supervisory control and data acquisition systems deployed in modern buildings and with users on mobile wireless platforms. There are, however, several technical challenges to confront before such a vision of smart building applications and cyber-physical systems can be realized. The sensory data produced by these systems need significant curation before it can be used meaningfully. This is largely a manual, cost-prohibitive task and hence such solutions rarely experience widespread adoption due to the lack of a common descriptive schema. Recent attempts have sought to address this through data standards and metadata schemata but fall short in capturing the richness of relationships required by applications. This paper describes Brick, a uniform metadata schema for representing buildings that builds upon recent advances in the area. Our schema defines a concrete ontology for sensors, subsystems and the relationships between them, which enables portable applications. We demonstrate the completeness and effectiveness of Brick by using it to represent the entire vendor-specific sensor metadata of six diverse buildings across different campuses, comprising 17,700 data points, and running eight unmodified energy efficiency applications on these buildings.},

This paper presents a critical review of data-driven methods, particularly those methods based on larger datasets, for building energy modeling and their practical applications for improving building performances. This paper is organized based on the four essential phases of big-data-driven modeling, i.e., data preprocessing, model development, knowledge post-processing, and practical applications throughout the building lifecycle. Typical data analysis and application methods have been summarized and compared at each stage, based upon which in-depth discussions and future research directions have been presented. This review demonstrates that the insights obtained from big building data can be extremely helpful for enriching the existing knowledge repository regarding building energy modeling. Furthermore, considering the ever-increasing development of smart buildings and IoT-driven smart cities, the big data-driven research paradigm will become an essential supplement to existing scientific research methods in the building sector.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen an increasing interest in Demand Response (DR) as a means to provide flexibility, and hence improve the reliability of energy systems in a cost-effective way. Yet, the high complexity of the tasks associated with DR, combined with their use of large-scale data and the frequent need for near real-time decisions, means that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) — a branch of AI — have recently emerged as key technologies for enabling demand-side response. AI methods can be used to tackle various challenges, ranging from selecting the optimal set of consumers to respond, learning their attributes and preferences, dynamic pricing, scheduling and control of devices, learning how to incentivise participants in the DR schemes and how to reward them in a fair and economically efficient way. This work provides an overview of AI methods utilised for DR applications, based on a systematic review of over 160 papers, 40 companies and commercial initiatives, and 21 large-scale projects. The papers are classified with regards to both the AI/ML algorithm(s) used and the application area in energy DR. Next, commercial initiatives are presented (including both start-ups and established companies) and large-scale innovation projects, where AI methods have been used for energy DR. The paper concludes with a discussion of advantages and potential limitations of reviewed AI techniques for different DR tasks, and outlines directions for future research in this fast-growing area.},

abstract = {In this paper, a tool for the detection and diagnosis of anomalous electrical daily energy patterns relative to a transformer substation of a university campus was developed and tested. Through an innovative pattern recognition analysis consisting in a multi-step clustering process, six clusters of anomalous daily load profiles were identified and isolated in two-year historical data of total electrical energy consumption. The infrequent electrical load profiles were found to be strongly affected, in terms of both shape and magnitude, by the energy consumption behaviour related to the heating/cooling mechanical room. Then, a fault-free predictive model, which uses artificial neural network (ANN) in combination with a Regression Tree, was developed to detect anomalous trends of the electrical energy consumption. The model was able to detect the 93.7{\%} of the anomalous profiles and only the 5{\%} of fault-free days were wrongly predicted as anomalous. Eventually, a diagnosis phase was conceived and validated with a testing data set. A number of daily abnormal load profiles were detected and compared with the centroids of the anomalous clusters identified in the pattern-recognition stage. The work led to the development of a flexible intelligent tool useful for operating a continuous commissioning of the campus facilities.},

To mitigate the impact of the growing demand, strategies are needed to improve buildings' energy efficiency. In residential buildings home appliances, water, and space heating are answerable for the increase of energy use, while space heating and other miscellaneous equipment are behind the increase of energy utilization in non-residential buildings. Building energy management systems support building managers and proprietors to increase energy efficiency in modern and existing buildings, non-residential and residential buildings can benefit from building energy management system to decrease energy use. Base on the type of building, different management strategies can be used to achieve energy savings. This paper presents a review of management strategies for building energy management systems for improving energy efficiency. Different management strategies are investigated in non-residential and residential buildings. Following this, the reviewed researches are discussed in terms of the type of buildings, building systems, and management strategies. Lastly, the paper discusses future challenges for the increase of energy efficiency in building energy management system.},

abstract = {Feature extraction from vibration signals is considerably significant for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. The Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) technique essentially transforming a real-valued time series into a symbol sequence, has been proven as a potential tool of feature extraction for machinery intelligent diagnosis. However, challenge still exists that the SAX cannot fulfill feature extraction tasks well since it is carried out only on the basis of mean value in time domain. To overcome this limitation, an improved SAX (ISAX) is proposed in this paper. This new method substitutes the feature of mean value in time domain with multiple features extracted from time, frequency and time-frequency domains in order to obtain comprehensive fault information. With the ISAX transformation, a vibration signal can be transformed into various symbol sequences according to the multi-domain features. Next the Shannon entropy technique is conducted on a symbol sequence to capture sequential patterns in local signals and then the Shannon entropy value is used as the eigenvalue of the symbol sequence. Various eigenvalues are obtained to describe a vibration signal from different perspectives, which leads to a better feature extraction. These eigenvalues are then fed into the Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) to reduce dimensions and extract principal features for classification tasks. Compared with SAX, the most significant advantage of ISAX is extracting comprehensive signal characteristics from multi-domain. Moreover, the ISAX captures fault information better considering the local fault patterns. The effectiveness and superiority of ISAX were validated by experimental studies using the fault signals of rolling bearings and reciprocating compressor valves with remarkably high classification rates.},

abstract = {Computing and networking systems traditionally record their activity in log files, which have been used for multiple purposes, such as troubleshooting, accounting, post-incident analysis of security breaches, capacity planning and anomaly detection. In earlier systems those log files were processed manually by system administrators, or with the support of basic applications for filtering, compiling and pre-processing the logs for specific purposes. However, as the volume of these log files continues to grow (more logs per system, more systems per domain), it is becoming increasingly difficult to process those logs using traditional tools, especially for less straightforward purposes such as anomaly detection. On the other hand, as systems continue to become more complex, the potential of using large datasets built of logs from heterogeneous sources for detecting anomalies without prior domain knowledge becomes higher. Anomaly detection tools for such scenarios face two challenges. First, devising appropriate data analysis solutions for effectively detecting anomalies from large data sources, possibly without prior domain knowledge. Second, adopting data processing platforms able to cope with the large datasets and complex data analysis algorithms required for such purposes. In this paper we address those challenges by proposing an integrated scalable framework that aims at efficiently detecting anomalous events on large amounts of unlabeled data logs. Detection is supported by clustering and classification methods that take advantage of parallel computing environments. We validate our approach using the the well known NASA Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) logs datasets. Fourteen features were extracted in order to train a k-means model for separating anomalous and normal events in highly coherent clusters. A second model, making use of the XGBoost system implementing a gradient tree boosting algorithm, uses the previous binary clustered data for producing a set of simple interpretable rules. These rules represent the rationale for generalizing its application over a massive number of unseen events in a distributed computing environment. The classified anomaly events produced by our framework can be used, for instance, as candidates for further forensic and compliance auditing analysis in security management.},

In this paper, we introduce a k-means based algorithm for symbolic representations of time series called adaptive Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (aSAX) and propose HOT aSAX algorithm for time series discords discovery.

abstract = {Thermal comfort assessment for the built environment has become more available to analysts and researchers due to the proliferation of sensors and subjective feedback methods. These data can be used for modeling comfort behavior to support design and opera- tions towards energy efficiency and well-being. By nature, occu- pant subjective feedback is imbalanced as indoor conditions are designed for comfort, and responses indicating otherwise are less common. This situation creates a scenario for the machine learning workflow where class balancing as a pre-processing step might be valuable for developing predictive thermal comfort classification models with high-performance. This paper investigates the various thermal comfort dataset class balancing techniques from the litera- ture and proposes a modified conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), comfortGAN, to address this imbalance scenario. These approaches are applied to three publicly available datasets, ranging from 30 and 67 participants to a global collection of ther- mal comfort datasets, with 1,474; 2,067; and 66,397 data points, respectively. This work finds that a classification model trained on a balanced dataset, comprised of real and generated samples from comfortGAN, has higher performance (increase between 4{\%} and 17{\%} in classification accuracy) than other augmentation methods tested. However, when classes representing discomfort are merged and reduced to three, better imbalanced performance is expected, and the additional increase in performance by comfortGAN shrinks to 1-2{\%}. These results illustrate that class balancing for thermal comfort modeling is beneficial using advanced techniques such as GANs, but its value is diminished in certain scenarios. A discussion is provided to assist potential users in determining which scenarios this process is useful and which method works best.},

abstract = {The recent increasing spread of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) has enabled the collection of a huge amount of building related-data which can be exploited by both energy suppliers and users to gain insight on energy consumption patterns. In this context, data analytics-based methodologies can play a key role for performing advanced characterization, benchmarking and classification of buildings according to their typical energy use in the time domain. Traditionally, energy customers are classified according to their building end-use category. However, buildings belonging to the same category can exhibit very different energy patterns making ineffective this kind of a-priori categorization. For this reason, load profiling frameworks have been developed in the last decade to identify homogenous groups of buildings with similar daily energy profiles. The present study proposes a non-intrusive customer classification process, which does not use as predictive attributes in-field load monitoring data for the classification of unknown customers, but rather monthly energy bills and additional information on customers' habits collected by means of a phone survey. The proposed classification process is developed by analysing hourly energy consumption data of 114 electrical customers of an Italian Energy Provider. The representative daily load profiles are grouped using the “Follow the Leader” clustering algorithm and a globally optimal decision tree is employed to build a supervised classification model. The model, compared to a baseline recursive partitioning tree, leads to an increase of accuracy of about 6{\%}. Eventually, the procedure exploits energy bill data also for estimating the magnitude of typical load profiles.},

abstract = {Energy management systems provide an opportunity to collect vast amounts of building-related data. The data contain abundant knowledge about the interactions between a building's energy consumption and the influencing factors. It is highly desirable that the hidden knowledge can be extracted from the data in order to help improve building energy performance. However, the data are rarely translated into useful knowledge due to their complexity and a lack of effective data analysis techniques. This paper first conducts a comprehensive review of the commonly used data analysis methods applied to building-related data. Both the strengths and weaknesses of each method are discussed. Then, the critical analysis of the previous solutions to three fundamental problems of building energy performance improvement that remain significant barriers is performed. Considering the limitations of those commonly used data analysis methods, data mining techniques are proposed as a primary tool to analyze building-related data. Moreover, a data analysis process and a data mining framework are proposed that enable building-related data to be analyzed more efficiently. The process refers to a series of sequential steps in analyzing data. The framework includes different data mining techniques and algorithms, from which a set of efficient data analysis methodologies can be developed. The applications of the process and framework to two sets of collected data demonstrate their applicability and abilities to extract useful knowledge. Particularly, four data analysis methodologies were developed to solve the three problems. For demonstration purposes, these methodologies were applied to the collected data. These methodologies are introduced in the published papers and are summarized in this paper.

abstract = {Commercial buildings consume a lot of energy and contribute a significant part of greenhouse gas emission. Many energy-saving or green-building initiatives were compromised by equipment and human-related faults under the umbrella of poor facility management. Data-driven building energy management is a cost-effective approach to improve energy efficiency of commercial buildings, and gains more and more popularity worldwide with the deployment of smart metering systems. This paper developed a systematic process of using smart metering data to quantify building daily load profiles (i.e. energy consumption patterns)with a set of statistics, e.g. base load, peak load, rising time and so on. Then prediction models of these building load statistics are constructed from historical training data consisting of energy consumption, environment and holiday information. At last residuals of the prediction models are analyzed to form statistical control charts. As a result anomaly energy consumption could be detected by comparing the predicted statistics and observed ones, which will help building managers to locate problems just in time. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is verified through real-world data analysis and computational studies.},

abstract = {While technology advancements are increasingly improving the energy efficiency of buildings, occupant behavior remains a critical factor in ensuring the effectiveness of such enhancements. To this end, numerous eco-feedback systems have been developed to reduce building energy use through adjusting occupants' behaviors. The information represented in an eco-feedback system affects the users' engagement, motivation, and interpretation. In this paper, we introduce a new information representation method in which a building information model (BIM) is integrated with energy use information to enhance visual representation of energy use. The BIM-integrated energy visualization approach developed in this paper allows users to visualize energy consumption values of each building room through a color-coding scheme in an as-built BIM. Colors correspond to the levels of energy consumption in individual rooms compared to other rooms in a building, which enables a visually intuitive normative comparison for building eco-feedback systems. This representation may lead to increased user engagement in and improved interpretation of eco-feedback systems.},

It explores the current state of research in thermal comfort domain through a systematic review to identify the gaps and opportunities specifically focusing on energy-intensive developing countries. This review argues that adaptive thermal comfort is a continuously evolving domain owing to dynamic modifications in occupant behavior occurring from changes in the cost of energy services and preference of comfort (rebound/pre-bound effect). A conceptual framework linking thermal comfort, rebound/pre-bound effect, and occupant behavior is forwarded through the introduction of an exogenous factor related to occupant well-being. The results ascertain that there is a need of localized thermal comfort model with an occupant-centric approach that can help in enhancing comfort and reducing energy consumption.},

Massive amounts of building operational data are being collected and available for knowledge discovery. Advanced data analytics are urgently needed to fully realize the potentials of big building operational data in enhancing building energy efficiency. The rapid development of data mining has provided powerful tools for extracting insights in various knowledge representations. Gradual pattern mining is a promising technique for discovering useful patterns from building operational data. The knowledge discovered is represented as gradual relationships, i.e., “the more/less A, the more/less B”. It can bring special interests to building energy management by highlighting co-variations among numerical building variables. This study investigated the usefulness of gradual pattern mining for building energy management. A generic methodology was proposed to ensure the quality and applicability of the knowledge discovered. The methodology was validated through a case study. The results showed that the methodology could successfully extract valuable insights on building operation characteristics and provide opportunities for building energy efficiency enhancement.},

@article{Fan2015,
abstract = {With the advances of information technologies, today's building automation systems (BASs) are capable of managing building operational performance in an efficient and convenient way. Meanwhile, the amount of real-time monitoring and control data in BASs grows continually in the building lifecycle, which stimulates an intense demand for powerful big data analysis tools in BASs. Existing big data analytics adopted in the building automation industry focus on mining cross-sectional relationships, whereas the temporal relationships, i.e., the relationships over time, are usually overlooked. However, building operations are typically dynamic and BAS data are essentially multivariate time series data. This paper presents a time series data mining methodology for temporal knowledge discovery in big BAS data. A number of time series data mining techniques are explored and carefully assembled, including the Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), motif discovery, and temporal association rule mining. This study also develops two methods for the efficient post-processing of knowledge discovered. The methodology has been applied to analyze the BAS data retrieved from a real building. The temporal knowledge discovered is valuable to identify dynamics, patterns and anomalies in building operations, derive temporal association rules within and between subsystems, assess building system performance and spot opportunities in energy conservation.},

The main features of e2-Diagnoser are: (i) fast extraction of a large portfolio of buildings' benchmarks at multiple places, and (ii) accurate prediction of buildings' energy usage down to sub meter level to detect and diagnose abnormal energy consumptions. Fundamentally, the e2-Diagnoser system is built on a novel statistical learning algorithm using the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to simultaneously monitor the mean and variation of the energy usage as well as identify the influencing factors such as weather conditions. Its implementation is based on stream processing platform that integrates data from various sources using semantic web technologies and provides an interactive user interface to visualize results. The platform is scalable and can be easily adapted to other applications such as smart-grid networks. Here we describe the architecture, methodology, and show the web-interface to demonstrate the main functions in the e2-Diagnoser.},

abstract = {Commonly used classification and regression tree methods like the CART algorithm are recursive partitioning methods that build the model in a forward stepwise search. Although this approach is known to be an efficient heuristic, the results of recursive tree methods are only locally optimal, as splits are chosen to maximize homogeneity at the next step only. An alternative way to search over the parameter space of trees is to use global optimization methods like evolutionary algorithms. This paper describes the evtree package, which implements an evolutionary algorithm for learning globally optimal classification and regression trees in R. Computationally intensive tasks are fully computed in C++ while the partykit package is leveraged for representing the resulting trees in R, providing unified infrastructure for summaries, visualizations, and predictions. evtree is compared to the open-source CART implementation rpart, conditional inference trees (ctree), and the open-source C4.5 implementation J48. A benchmark study of predictive accuracy and complexity is carried out in which evtree achieved at least similar and most of the time better results compared to rpart, ctree, and J48. Furthermore, the usefulness of evtree in practice is illustrated in a textbook customer classification task.},

We further regularize the solution to avoid the detection of isolated examples and examples on the boundary of the distribution support.

abstract = {This paper presents a data mining (DM) based approach to developing ensemble models for predicting next-day energy consumption and peak power demand, with the aim of improving the prediction accuracy. This approach mainly consists of three steps. Firstly, outlier detection, which merges feature extraction, clustering analysis, and the generalized extreme studentized deviate (GESD), is performed to remove the abnormal daily energy consumption profiles. Secondly, the recursive feature elimination (RFE), an embedded variable selection method, is applied to select the optimal inputs to the base prediction models developed separately using eight popular predictive algorithms. The parameters of each model are then obtained through leave-group-out cross validation (LGOCV). Finally, the ensemble model is developed and the weights of the eight predictive models are optimized using genetic algorithm (GA). The approach is adopted to analyze the large energy consumption data of the tallest building in Hong Kong. The prediction accuracies of the ensemble models measured by mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are 2.32{\%} and 2.85{\%} for the next-day energy consumption and peak power demand respectively, which are evidently higher than those of individual base models. The results also show that the outlier detection method is effective in identifying the abnormal daily energy consumption profiles. The RFE process can significantly reduce the computation load while enhancing the model performance. The ensemble models are valuable for developing strategies of fault detection and diagnosis, operation optimization and interactions between buildings and smart grid. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper examines the visualization of symbolic data and considers the challenges rising from its complex structure. Symbolic data is usually aggregated from large data sets and used to hide entry specific details and to transform huge amounts of data (like big data) into analyzable quantities. It is also used to offer an overview in places where general trends are more important than individual details. Symbolic data comes in many forms like intervals, histograms, categories and modal multi-valued objects. Symbolic data can also be considered as a distribution. Currently, the de facto visualization approach for symbolic data is zoomstars which has many limitations. The biggest limitation is that the default distributions (histograms) are not supported in 2D as additional dimension is required. This paper proposes several new improvements for zoomstars which would enable it to visualize histograms in 2D by using a quantile or an equivalent interval approach. In addition, several improvements for categorical and modal variables are proposed for a clearer indication of presented categories. Recommendations for different approaches to zoomstars are offered depending on the data type and the desired goal. Furthermore, an alternative approach that allows visualizing the whole data set in comprehensive table-like graph, called shape encoding, is proposed. These visualizations and their usefulness are verified with three symbolic data sets in exploratory data mining phase to identify trends, similar objects and important features, detecting outliers and discrepancies in the data.},
